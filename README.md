# Statistical Programming
### Course Description: 
Programming structures and algorithms for large-scale statistical data processing and
visualization. Students will use commonly available data analysis software packages to
apply concepts and skills to large data sets and will also develop their own code using
an object oriented programming language.

### Learning Outcomes
#### Course Student Learning Outcomes
1. Implement algorithms using Python as the programming language.
2. Employ various data structures for storing and accessing datasets.
3. Identify common problems in datasets and methods of preparing data for
analysis.
4. Visualize data using an application programmerâ€™s interface.
5. Develop programs to perform statistical analysis of various kinds of data

#### Program Student Learning Outcomes
1. Write software that efficiently implements the mathematical techniques
required to extract meaning from large data sets, primarily using off-the-shelf
mathematical software tools.
2. Develop appropriate querying mechanisms for asking questions about
large data sets and obtaining answers of sufficient accuracy with reasonable
investment of computing power.
3. Apply clustering algorithms to characterize large data sets in terms of
subsets with similar properties.
4. Create and choose visualization approaches that most clearly depict the
characteristics of the data that need to be communicated for a particular purpose.

### Baccalaureate Characteristics/Graduate Student Learning Outcomes
1. Synthesize theoretical and research concepts from multiple perspectives
to inform inquiry and practice.
2. Formulate creative responses to complex issues through critical
analysis.
